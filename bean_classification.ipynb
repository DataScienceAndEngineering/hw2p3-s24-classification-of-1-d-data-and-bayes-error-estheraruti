    "#### b. In python just using numerical functions (you can take 1000 data points from min of weight x=1 to x=8) compute the theoretical probabilities from part a. Use matplotlib to make a curves showing the probability of classifying something class A assuming it is really class B (C=B), in other words P(C=A|C=B) is the figure y-axis, as a function of T, the figure x-axis. Similarly plot P(C=Bâˆ£C=A) as a function of T. Putting these together since P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, adding the curves and dividing by 2 you get the probability of miss-classification or Bayes error as a function of T. Plot that as well."
